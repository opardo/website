  I explored our users' behavior by...

  * Abstracting features in common of people who use each of the paid and organic channels to land on our platform.
  * Discovering sequences of different channel landings with the best and worst booking rates.
  
  And the results of these actions were...

  * Empowered our marketing team to design channel strategies according to such characteristics and sequences, and provided them with time-series dashboards to verify if the peculiarities of each channel remain in time.
  * Proposed a new customer-centric metric framework to measure the popularity, effectiveness and influence of each channel. It was the first framework in the history of our team to consider that a certain user may like several channels.

   Implemented efficient summarizing data algorithms for a real-time analytics platform, using Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas.
