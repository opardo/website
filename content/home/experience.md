  * Designed a novel customer-centric metric framework that is the first-ever to account for the possibility of users liking multiple channels.

   Implemented efficient summarizing data algorithms for a real-time analytics platform, using Python libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas.

   Being my first and a part-time job, my work here was more operational. However, I consider this a crucial work experience, since I learned a lot of coding skills (version control, efficiency, cleanliness, readibility) that would be useful later in my career.
